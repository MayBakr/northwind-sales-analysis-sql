# Strategic Analysis of Northwind Sales Data

***Project Overview***  
This project provides a detailed, data-driven analysis of Northwind sales data to uncover customer behavior, product performance, order trends, and employee contributions. The goal is to generate actionable insights that support business strategy and decision-making.  

## Key Objectives
- Analyze customer segmentation and order behavior.  
- Evaluate product performance and identify slow movers.  
- Examine order trends and seasonality patterns.  
- Assess employee performance metrics.  
- Generate actionable insights to inform business strategy.  

## SQL Skills & Techniques Demonstrated
- Data querying, aggregation, and filtering.  
- RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis for customer segmentation.  
- Ranking and percentiles for order and customer value analysis.  
- Joins across multiple tables (`Orders`, `Order Details`, `Products`, `Employees`, `Customers`).  
- Grouping and categorizing data for actionable insights.  
- Views creation to simplify complex queries.  

## Analysis Highlights

### 1. Customer Segmentation
- Grouped customers based on RFM metrics and average order value.  
- Identified key customer segments: **Champions**, **Potential Loyalists**, and **At Risk**.  

### 2. Product Performance Analysis
- Ranked top revenue-generating and high-frequency products.  
- Highlighted slow movers for strategic inventory decisions.  

### 3. Order Analysis
- Examined seasonality by month and day of the week.  
- Categorized orders into **Small**, **Medium**, and **Large** based on total quantity.  

### 4. Employee Performance Evaluation
- Evaluated employees based on **total revenue**, **order volume**, and **average order value**.
